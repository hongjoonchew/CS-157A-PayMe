# CS-157A-PayMe
Introduction to Database Management Systems Project. Built using Spring Initialzr framework and mySQL as the database.

### What did we work on this project
This project was mainly Database Management System project, so most of this was focused on the back-end instead. But we did a lot on the front-end as well!
- We used Bootstrap as our HTML/CSS framework, but sadly this website is not responsive (might work on that in the future!)
- This project had Spring Security, Spring Boot, and Spring MVC implemented into the system.
- Spring JDBC was used as well for the back-end to connect with mySQL.


[We got it deployed on Heroku!](https://payme157a.herokuapp.com)
